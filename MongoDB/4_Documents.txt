- MongoDB stores data records as BSON documents. BSON is a Binary representation of JSON documents.

- When we added or when we inserted a new student, when the collection doesn't exist it create a new  collection.

student = {
    "name" : "Sang",
    "mail" : "a@b",
    "gender" : "F",
    "totalBook": 0
}

1: paste object in terminal.
2: db.student.insert(student);

- Size of collection: db.student.count();
- Find all document in collection: db.student.find();
